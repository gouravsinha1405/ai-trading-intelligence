    ðŸš¨ **Import Error**: {str(e)}
    
    This usually means a dependency failed to install on Streamlit Cloud.
    
    **Common Solutions**:
    1. Check that all packages in requirements.txt are available on Linux
    2. Use `>=` instead of `==` for version pinning
    3. Remove packages that require system-level dependencies
    4. Try deploying again (sometimes it's a temporary issue)
