# üöÄ Railway Deployment Guide
## AI Trading Platform with Authentication

This guide will help you deploy your AI Trading Platform to Railway with secure authentication and admin controls.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account** - Your code repository
2. **Railway Account** - Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. **Groq API Key** - Get free key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

## üîß Pre-Deployment Setup

### 1. Update Environment Variables

Before deploying, update your production credentials in Railway:

```bash
# Required Environment Variables for Railway
AUTH_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-minimum-32-characters
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-admin-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
```

### 2. Security Configuration

**üîê Important Security Settings:**

- **AUTH_SECRET_KEY**: Generate a strong 32+ character secret
- **ADMIN_PASSWORD**: Use a strong password (min 12 characters)
- **ADMIN_USERNAME**: Change from default 'admin'

## üöÄ Railway Deployment Steps
