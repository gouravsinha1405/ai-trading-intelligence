    Provide a focused analysis of the quantitative trading platform landscape in 2025:
    
    Current Major Players:
    1. QuantConnect - cloud-based algorithmic trading
    2. Numerai - data science tournament for hedge fund
    3. WorldQuant - global quantitative investment
    4. Kaggle Financial Competitions
    5. Alpha Architect - factor investing platform
    6. QuantRocket - institutional-grade platform
    7. Zipline - open source backtesting (Quantopian legacy)
    
    For this analysis, focus on:
    
    **MARKET GAPS** (Most Important):
    - What are retail/small institutional traders NOT getting from current platforms?
    - What features do they want but can't access?
    - What's too expensive or complex in current offerings?
    
    **PRICING OPPORTUNITIES**:
    - Where is pricing creating barriers to entry?
    - What would a more accessible pricing model look like?
    
    **TECHNOLOGY GAPS**:
    - What modern AI/ML capabilities are missing?
    - Where are platforms using outdated tech?
    
    **DATA ACCESS ISSUES**:
    - What data sources are expensive but could be democratized?
    - Where are there data monopolies we could challenge?
    
    Give me the top 3 biggest opportunities for a new platform to disrupt this space.
